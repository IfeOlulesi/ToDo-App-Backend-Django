Steps to take in designing my todo app
  1 - The Project
    - What does it do? 
    - Who's going to be using the app?
    - What are they going to use it for?
    - How can it be arranged in an intuitive way? 

    Brainstorm the audience
      - Who's using the app
      - In what situation would they use the app?
